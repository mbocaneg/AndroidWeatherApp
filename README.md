# AndroidWeatherApp
An simple android weather app laid out in the style of the MVP architecture. It fetches current weather data, as well as a 5 day forecast, from the openweathermap api, using the retrofit client.

# Usage
Simply import the project into Android Studio, and then add your openweathermap api key into the file `ApiUtils.java` as the string `API_KEY`.
